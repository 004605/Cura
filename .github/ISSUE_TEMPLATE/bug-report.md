<!--
Processing an issue will go much faster when this is filled out, and issues which do not use this template WILL BE REMOVED and no fix will be considered!

Before filing, PLEASE check if the issue already exists (either open or closed) by using the search bar on the issues page. If it does, comment there. Even if it's closed, we can reopen it based on your comment.

Also, please note the application version in the title of the issue. For example: "[3.2.1] Cannot connect to 3rd-party printer". Please do NOT write things like "Request:" or "[BUG]" in the title; this is what labels are for.

Thank you for using Cura!

**Application version**
(The version of the application this issue occurs with.)

**Platform**
(Information about the operating system the issue occurs on. Include at least the operating system.
In the case of visual glitches/issues, also include information about your graphics drivers and GPU.)

**Printer**
(Which printer was selected in Cura?

**Reproduction steps**
1. Something you did.
2. Something you did next.

**Screenshot(s)**
Adding screenshot(s) is a very good idea to identify what exactly the problem is. We get lots of bug reports and a 
screenshot is also a great help to tell them apart without downloading and opening a project file. Feel
free to add text either inside or below the screenshots. Before (earlier, working version of Cura) / After 
(Problematic version of Cura) screenshots might work well, too. 

**Actual results**
(What happens after the above steps have been followed.)

**Expected results**
(What should happen after the above steps have been followed.)

**Project file**
Provide a project which clearly shows the bug.
Rather than providing a model file, provide a project (.3mf or .curaproject) file. This will include all the settings 
you used, which is crucial to reproducing your problem.
To upload a project, try changing the extension to e.g. bug_example.3mf.zip so that GitHub accepts uploading the file.
If the file is too big, we recommend http://wetransfer.com, but other file hosts like Google Drive or Dropbox work 
well too. Please make sure the file is publicly available ie. "shared with everyone"

**Log file**
It is important to provide a log file. It might provide us info about why a certain material was selected, or is not 
compatible, for example.
Information about how to find the log file can be found at https://github.com/Ultimaker/Cura#logging-issues
